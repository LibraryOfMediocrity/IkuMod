# The Fish is Here

Adds Iku Nagae to Touhou: Lost Branch of Legend.
Includes the standard amount of cards (idk how much yet) complete with off-colours.

# Overview

Colours: U/R  

## Iku U:

- Veils: Shuffle a selected card into the draw pile and reduce its cost by 2 nrecureutral.
- Certain cards have effects that trigger when the card is veiled.  
- Allows for deck control and mana cheat
  
## Iku R:

- Surge: played attack cards deal 50% more damage, consuming 1 surge.
- Some cards have a Conduit effect that consumes 1 surge to activate.
- Big damage, basically.
  
# Some Notes

- Some attack cards have conduit effects. These require 2 surge to get both the damage and conduit effect.
If you only have 1 surge, you only get the damage.
- If you have surge with knives or potions, do **NOT** trust the damage numbers. They are **LYING**.
The game calculates their preview damage because they are attack cards, but if they are not played, they do not get that damage.
- There are buffs that veil played cards. These will not trigger if the card was exiled, if it was an ability or tool, if it was a teammate
being summoned(but not if it was already summoned, e.g. actives), or if the card had been veiled by some other effect already.
